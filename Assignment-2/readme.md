Assignment 2 - Implementation of Bisection method using python 3

The Bisection method is a simple root finding Algorithm. The root is found by
successivly halving the search space for the root until the root is found.

Test Equations - 
1. x**2−5x−7 = 0  
      Roots - (-1.1404) and 6.1395
2. x**3+8x = 0  
      Roots - 0.0
